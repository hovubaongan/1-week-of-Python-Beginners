# 1-week-of-Python-Beginners
This is a project of subprojects of mine in learning Python. This includes my project in automating Excel processing, machine learning throughcreating a music-recommender machine as well as building an online Grocery shop using Django
Please be aware that I’m not any professional Python programmer. I just followed the tutorial from “Programming with Mosh”(url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t=17943s) and decided to put out my work here so as to track my progress.
Please also take note (if you even take interest in it) that to access the website, import the files into PyCharm in the form of project and type $python3 manage.py runserver. This will give you the link to the main website. 
If you have any word of advice or constructive criticism, I would really appreciate your honesty ^^
